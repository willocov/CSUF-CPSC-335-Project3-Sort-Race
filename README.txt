CPSC 335-05 Project 3 Sorting Race
Team Name: WOC
Team Members: William Covington

Intro:
This project displays the efficiency of 3 different sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort.
Arrays are printed after each pass (or step) or the sorting algorithms.
Once an array is sorted, the algorithm will stop.

Notes on Quick Sort:
-The rightmost element in the array or subarray will be used as the pivot.
-All elements in the array or subarray that are equal to the pivot will be moved to the subarray.
